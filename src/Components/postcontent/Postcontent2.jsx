     <p>All the digital games that were made were created in Unity, except for the Twine games, Those games were created in a software known as Twine.
       When creating these games we would usually have a time limit of 2 weeks sometimes a week to create the games. In often times there were new elements that had 
       to be learned meaning art as well as code would oftentimes be rushed. This ,however, was done to show how we would work under time constraints. All my games were 
       made in time and I had enjoyed creating all of them.

      <p>The first game that was tasked by the University was to create a unique version of the old game known as Pong. The idea I had created was to create a 2 player 
      pong game where there were 2 paddles on each side that would consistently change size making the game harder. As with all the digital games made on this page 
      currently 
      (except for the Twine games), It was made in Unity.

      <p>This task was to create a unique version of the popular billiard game otherwise known as pool. The version I had created would have barriers at the centre 
        to make playing the game much harder, this would require players to plan out how they go about making their moves. The added time limit was also introduced to add 
        to the difficulty.

      <p>This was a mobile game. Unfortunately, this game requires a phone to be connected and during the recording, there were no phones connected that could play the game. 
        Players are met with an endless runner where they can move up and down, however instead of a person they are in control of a 2D car driving against the traffic. The 
        the top score is counted and players aim to break their record.

      <p>This game was meant to be a platformer where we had to have an enemy that would shoot at the player and an enemy that would walk and try to attack the player.
       The player was tasked with finding a key that would open a door and let the player escape. </p>

      <p>This game was made with the task of not being a shooter, as in the title it had to be an alternate FPS game. I decided to create a maze and puzzle game.
        Players would need to go through the maze to find the centre where they can escape. The puzzle game required players to move blocks in order
         to progress through the levels.

      <p>This was a game made during the June exam season at WITs. We were given all the assets, however, we were tasked with creating an animation cycle for the character
        as well as adding a key and portal feature, where players would only be able to win once they had the key. we were then tasked with adding an enemy that could run and 
        attack while being animated and an enemy that would shoot projectiles at the player while being animated.

      <p>This was one of the last games that I had created for Game Design in 2020 where we would have to design a unique game using all the knowledge we had acquired 
        through the year from the ground up. I decided to create a grapple hook game where players would need to traverse the world using a grapple hook. Players would be able to 
        pull objects towards them and pull themselves to certain objects, swing from platform to platform as well as throw out a rope dart that would destroy objects and 
        turrents.

      <p>The game that needed to be created was an Infinite shooter. We were given the player model and enemy model, Which we then had to animate and create weapons for.
        I then had to transfer the models from Blender to Unity and create the game, creating enemy pathing, and levels as well as adding a feature for the player to 
        both shoot and die.

      <p>This was the first Twine game I had created. This was a Zombie game set within the era of the Black Plague where players would play as a Plague Doctor 
        who just wants to help but also needs to focus on their own survival. Resources are scarce and time is an important feature. This is where the element of a 
        time limit is added as well as an inventory feature where players can only hold one object. Players will also need to make tough choices which can lead the players 
        through many different paths.

      <p>This was the second Twine game I had created. In it players go through the life of a University student one that they make from the ground up by
         naming them, deciding how they will look 
        picking their pronouns, the degree that they'll do, their traits, their relationships and whether they'll survive at University or not. The players need to manage different 
        stats in order to ensure that their character survives University life while maintaining relationships and their readiness for each exam. Should the player fail at 
        any of these elements they lose the game and are sent home. There are many different paths that can be found within this game.

      <h2>Sims Twine Game</h2>
      <h5>Created in 2021</h5>

      <p>This Twine game is the only game that was created in 2021 and was a group project. Here we created a game similar to the game series known as 'The Sims'.
        We, however, added a twist that the person that the players were playing as was not from the Sims world and had a brief recollection of their past. The main goal 
        of the player was to find out what happened and where they were. We had incorporated mechanics from the Sims such as tasks of upgrading skills, searching for a job and 
        ensuring your survival, all working together so that players could achieve their end goal while being as truthful to the source material of the Sims.
