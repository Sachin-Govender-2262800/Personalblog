      <p>This is a page designed to display all the animations that I have created. As of right now, all the animations 
        that have been made were created during my University years. These projects were animated in many different softwares
         such as Blender, Krita, Sony Vegas, Wondershare and Movie Maker.</p>

      <p>This was the first animation that was created by me for my degree. The ball with legs had already been provided by our lecturers  
        and the task was to create a realistic walk cycle using Blender.</p>

      <h2>Jumping ball with tail</h2>
      <h5>Made in 2021</h5>

      <p>This was the second animation I was tasked with making. The ball with a tail was once again provided to us, and we were tasked with creating a jumping animation for the object. 
        The object, however, it had to be animated with personality. This was all done with Blender

      <p>In this animation, we were tasked with creating a 10-second clip (that could go over and under by 2 seconds).
        I created a short horror story in Krita using 2D animation and then used Movie Makers to play the audio alongside the clip. In the clip,
         we are met with what seems to be a horrific scene before we are shown the whole picture.   </p>

      <p>The task in this assignment was to use the 2 models provided by the lecturers to create a scene where the characters are talking.
         The main goal was to see how well we could Sync our character's mouths to the audio. The audio I used came from the 1992 Batman: The Animated Series
          where the Joker sings a Christmas carols. This was made in Blender. </p>

      <h2>Lyric video </h2>

      <p>This was the final animation project that I had created for WIT's. I made a lyric music video using the song known as 'With You' by Josh A and Jakehill. 
        The video was created using Blender (for the backgrounds) and Krita (for the characters and car). The audio as well as putting the animation together
         was then edited using Sony Vegas and Wondershare.
